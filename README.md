#  PCB Defect Detection using Raspberry Pi 5 and YOLOv8

An automated **Printed Circuit Board (PCB) defect detection system** built with **Raspberry Pi 5**, **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)**, and **OpenCV**.  
This project identifies common PCB manufacturing defects such as **missing components, soldering faults, and track cuts** in **real time** on edge hardware.
Trained and fine-tuned a YOLOv8 deep learning model to detect defects. 
Implemented image preprocessing, augmentation, and model optimization to improve accuracy and real-time performance.
